# Percolate
Programs to test whether a grid can be percolated through.

Initially this will only be for 2D grids. Once this is working and tested I will try it for 3D grids.

To build; run make
To run; run ./Percolate file.txt numberOfTrials
where file.txt must be of the format: #rows
									  #columns
									  density 

To generate documentation; run doxygen Doxyfile.
